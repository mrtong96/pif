Phase 1: Politician Index Fund

	Goal was to provide investment recommendations by using public data on politician investments and transactions

	The assumption is that politicians are able to make better investment decisions

	Using Keras

	However, this model failed since it was unable to make predictions more accurate than random guessing

		One possible reason was that our assumption that politicians make better investment decisions than the general public was flawed

			Maybe only certain politicians are making better investment decisions. The difficulty is knowing which politicians.
		
		Another possible reason was that there was not enough data to train the model successfully. It was possible the model needed more politician investment data in order to make accurate predictions.


Phase 2: Math-based investment strategy

	A research paper (https://maslov.bioengineering.illinois.edu/optimal_investment_ijtaf.pdf)  used statistics in order to calculate the optimal investment strategy
	
	Goal was to implement this method in our code

	Did not involve any machine learning
	
	Inputs

		Max number of stocks (desired max number of stocks to be recommended to invest in)

		Investment windows days (length of time user plans to hold these stocks before selling)

		Start date (how far back to look at historical data of stocks to provide better recommendations)

	Outputs

		Ticker names with corresponding recommended investment proportions

		Expected total return (mean)

		Variance and standard deviation

		Confidence intervals (probability that expected return will fall within a range)

	This method appeared to be successful since the stocks recommended seemed to have mostly positive trends
